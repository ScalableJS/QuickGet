# Service worker death between pause and cancel/resume

**Severity:** medium · **Area:** background
**Files:** `src/background/downloads.ts`

Raised by an external review of the BUG-2 fix. MV3 terminates the service worker on its own
schedule — an unreachable NAS can outlive it — so neither the cancel nor the resume runs and
the browser download stays paused with nothing left to release it. Precisely the failure case
the fix was meant to cover.

The reviewer's remedy was to drop `pause` entirely (`send → cancel on success, otherwise leave
it alone`). Rejected: without a pause the `.torrent` usually lands on disk, which is what
interception exists to prevent.

**Done 2026-08-28** — a `qg-pending-<id>` marker in `chrome.storage.session` is written before
the hand-off and cleared in a `finally`. `recoverAbandonedHandoffs()` runs on every worker
start and resumes whatever was left behind. Session storage survives a worker restart but not
a browser restart, which is the right lifetime: a download interrupted by a browser restart is
not resumable anyway.

**Related, found while testing this:** `onCreated` and `onChanged` can both recognise the same
download, and a claim implemented as `await get()` then `set()` let both callers read
"unclaimed" and send the torrent twice — visible in E2E as the torrent host being fetched five
times instead of three. The claim is now taken synchronously from an in-memory set before the
first await, with the session marker carrying it across restarts.

**Superseded 2026-08-30** — persistent pending/claim markers, startup recovery and the duplicate
task Resume notification were removed. Only a synchronous in-memory guard remains for
concurrent `onCreated`/`onChanged` events; it disappears when the operation or worker ends.
