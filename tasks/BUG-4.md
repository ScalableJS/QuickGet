# Hand-off failure swallowed by `sendAndNotify`

**Severity:** medium · **Area:** background
**Files:** `src/background/downloads.ts:79-82`

Catches, notifies, and returns normally, so a rejected NAS operation becomes a fulfilled
promise. The caller cannot tell success from failure and cannot roll the download back.
On its own cosmetic — but it is what makes BUG-2 silent.

**Root cause:** under `"ask"` the function was called from a notification-button handler with
no caller to propagate to, so swallowing was correct. The refactor made it a step in a
sequence that needs the result.

**Fix:** separate the critical operation from the notification; let the error propagate.
Ship with BUG-2.
**Done 2026-08-27** — `sendAndNotify()` is gone. `handOffToNas()` keeps the critical operation
and the rollback in one place, and the error reaches the caller instead of being absorbed.
